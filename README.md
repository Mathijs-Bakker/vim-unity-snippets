# Unity Snippets

A collection of snippets for Unity development.

## Snippet Engines suporting vim-unity-snippets

Snippets are supported by the following engines:
* [SirVer/ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips): python, supports all snippets in this repo.
* [garbas/vim-snipmate](garbas/vim-snipmate): VimL, snipmate-snippets, engine sometimes behaves strange. Supports snippets/*
* [Shougo/neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim): VimL, supports snippets/* with some configuration.
Note: I only use UltiSnips so I did not test these snippets on the other engines. If someone does, please send me message of your experience. So I can update this readme for other readers.

## Installation
Just like any other snippet.
